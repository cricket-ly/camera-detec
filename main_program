# The full process of detecting markers and sending the data to the websocket to update the table.

###############
# GLOBAL RETRIEVAL
# 1) Retrieve data from the GLOBAL grid
# Want to know the global ROWS, COLS, and ORIGINAL PROPERTIES
    # By properties, we mean the original 'color', 'height', 'id', 'interactive', and 'name'
    # This is so we have the original data, which we will update portions of later

# 2) Return the global_rows, global_cols, and original_properties
"""NOTE: this is in the test_python.py"""


###############
# INITIALIZING THE GRID
# 1) Figure out what portion of the GLOBAL grid we will be updating
    # Ask which index of the GLOBAL grid is the top left corner of the LOCAL grid
    # Ask for local_rows, local_cols

# 2) Return a list of integers which represent the GLOBAL indexes that will need to be updated

# 3) Create the grid (matrix of coordinate points that the camera will check for ArUco markers)
    # Use the local_rows, local_cols from before

# 4) Return the grid of coordinates that the camera will be detecting markers in

"""NOTE: this is in aruco_id_detector.py, with the calibration functions. will need to be updated."""


###############
# DETECTION & MAPPING
# 1) Detect the markers with the camera

# 2) Map the ArUco markers detected to their properties ('color', 'height', 'id', 'interactive', and 'name')

"""NOTE: this is in aruco_id_detector.py"""


###############
# UPDATING THE GLOBAL GRID
# We have the information of the markers in from the LOCAL grid. Now we need to update
# the GLOBAL grid to have this information
"""NOTE: I think this is in the another_test.py file"""


###############
# SENDING TO WEBSOCKET
# Note: since we're compiling everything into this main_program file, I think we only need one async
# 1) Connect to the websocket

# 2) Send the updated GLOBAL grid


"""NOTE: check the aruco_id_detector.py; started combining stuff there but will need to
undo the combining that I did. Basically, separate it so aruco_id_detector only does the
detecting and mapping."""
