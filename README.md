This project will use OpenCV to detect and record information from ArUco markers. Libraries used are OpenCV - 4.10.0 and NumPy - 2.0.0.
(Make sure to have the correct versions; otherwise, code may not work. Use 'pip install --upgrade numpy' and 'pip install --upgrade opencv-python' to troubleshoot).
